// Extend the Account class by creating a class called SavingsAccount in a file called
// savingsaccount.js. In addition to the attributes of Account, SavingsAccount
// should have an interest variable, which is set in the constructor and has a getter and a setter
// mehtod. It should also have an addInterest() method which deposits the interest amount
// into the account. The calculation for the amount is balance * interest / 100 . Be sure to also
// overwrite the toString() method, and create Mocha / Chai tests for the methods in
// SavingsAccount. You do not have to test the methods that SavingsAccount receives
// from Account, since theyâ€™ve already been tested in Account




class SavingAccount extends Account {

    constructor(accountNumber,interest) {
        super(accountNumber)
        this.interest = interest
    }

    get interest() {
        return this._interest;
